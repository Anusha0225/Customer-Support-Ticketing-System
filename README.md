1. Created a new Lightning App named "Customer Support Ticketing System".                                                       
2. Standard objects such as Contacts and Users (for customers and agents).                                                      
    Contacts → represent customers submitting tickets.                                                                    
    Users → represent support agents handling tickets.
3. Created custom objects for tracking support operations.                                                             
4. Created fields for each custom object using Fields & Relationships.                                                          
5. Finally created Tabs for each custom object created.

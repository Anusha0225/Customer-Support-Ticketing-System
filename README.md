Created a new Lightning App named "Customer Support Ticketing System".
Standard objects such as Contacts and Users (for customers and agents). Contacts → represent customers submitting tickets.
Users → represent support agents handling tickets.
Created custom objects for tracking support operations.
Created fields for each custom object using Fields & Relationships.
Finally created Tabs for each custom object created.
